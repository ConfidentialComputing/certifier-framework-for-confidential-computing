In order for the sev certifier tests to work, you must first generate some test files
in install sev drivers as described in the instructionstxt in sev-snp-simulator.
You must then copy the two files, ec-secp384r1-priv-key.pem and ec-secp384r1-pub-key.pem
into src.  You must also run the tests as root. None of the other certifier tests require
special treatment.
