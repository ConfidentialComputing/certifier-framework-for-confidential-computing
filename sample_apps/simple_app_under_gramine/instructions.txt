Instructions for building and running the sample application and generating policy for
                 the Certifier Service using the policy utilities under Gramine. 
======================================================================================

# Overview:
-----------
This uses the same application as in .../sample_app but under Gramine.
A Gramine enclave uses SGX instructions to generate SGX quotes and reports. On initial
deployment, Gramine communicates with the Quoting Enclave(QE) to get the SGX quote.
The QE talks to the PCE to obtain the attestation collateral with the help of Intel
Provisioning Certification Service(PCS). The certificates are cached locally. When an SGX
quote is received, users can compare the certificates embedded in the quote against these
cached certificates.

This app uses two scripts, a Makefile and the SGX manifest to setup.
The steps below describe building and running the Gramine example app.


# System Requirements:
----------------------
Platform - Intel Coffee Lake or later with Intel SGX, Intel SPS and Intel ME. Intel NUCs
with SGX capability should also work as long as they support Intel FLC.
OS - Ubuntu 20.04 or later with Linux kernel 5.11 or higher

# Software Repositories:
------------------------
1. Clone Gramine
```
mkdir gramine
cd gramine
git clone https://github.com/gramineproject/gramine.git gramine
```

2. Clone Certifier
cd ..
Clone certifier in the same directory as the parent of the outer gramine dir above.

```
git clone https://github.com/vmware-research/certifier-framework-for-confidential-computing.git certifier
```

# Steps to install Gramine:
---------------------------
3. Build Gramine
Steps required to build Gramine are provided here:
https://gramine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/devel/building.html

Detailed required steps from the link above are listed here:

3a. First install a Linux OS such as Ubuntu 20.04 with Linux kernel 5.11 or higher which
has SGX drivers built in. SGX drivers help in setting up the SGX-specific instructions
on the CPU and the QE/PCE.

3b. Install common dependencies as in the link above:
```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential \
    autoconf bison gawk nasm ninja-build pkg-config python3 python3-click \
    python3-jinja2 python3-pip python3-pyelftools wget
sudo python3 -m pip install 'meson>=0.56' 'tomli>=1.1.0' 'tomli-w>=0.4.0'
```

3c. Install SGX dependencies as in the link above:
```
sudo apt-get install -y libprotobuf-c-dev protobuf-c-compiler \
    protobuf-compiler python3-cryptography python3-pip python3-protobuf
```

3d. Install Intel SGX SDK/PSW as in the link above:
If using kernel 5.11 or higher, SGX drivers are already built in and need not be
installed explicitly.
This link provides all the steps required:
https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-dcap/1.14/linux/docs/Intel_SGX_SW_Installation_Guide_for_Linux.pdf
This document also has steps to configure PCCS on local machine to ensure Intel PCS
communication is setup correctly.

3e. Install dependencies for DCAP:
```
curl -fsSL https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu/intel-sgx-deb.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo 'deb [arch=amd64] https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu focal main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intel-sgx.list
# (if you're on Ubuntu 18.04, write "bionic" instead of "focal" above)

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsgx-dcap-quote-verify-dev
```

3f. Build Gramine
```
meson setup build/ --buildtype=release -Ddirect=enabled -Dsgx=enabled -Dsgx_driver=upstream -Ddcap=enabled
ninja -C build/
sudo ninja -C build/ install
```

# Obtain Intel Certificates:
----------------------------
4. PCKIDRetrievalTool is used to obtain the Intel platform certificates that include the
root certificate and the PCK certificate chain. Install and run the SGX PCK ID retrieval
tool:
```
sudo apt install sgx-pck-id-retrieval-tool
```
Currently we use the Intel Root Certificate obtained by running the tool above. Copy the
root certificate to gramine_example_app.crt (file to be renamed later).

# Steps to run Gramine app:
---------------------------
App uses the installed Gramine SDK, Intel SGX/DCAP drivers and MbedTLS libraries for
basic functionality.

This example embeds the policy key in the application using embed_policy_key.exe.

$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE is the top level directory for the certifier repository.  On my
computer, it is in ~/src/github.com/jlmucb/crypto/v2/certifier-framework-for-confidential-computing.
It is helpful to have a shell variable for it:

export CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE=~/src/github.com/jlmucb/crypto/v2/certifier-framework-for-confidential-computing

$GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR is this directory containing the example application.  Again, a shell variable is useful.

export GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR=$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/sample_apps/simple_app_under_gramine

5. Setup MbedTLS
----------------
This script obtains the MbedTLS library and configures it to be used by an application.
Gramine APIs use the MbedTLS to encrypt/decrypt buffers or to obtain hashes.
```
cd $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR
./configureMbedTLS
```

6. Setup policy key and certificate
-----------------------------------
6a. Generate the policy key and self-signed cert
```
mkdir $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR/provisioning
cd $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR/provisioning
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/cert_utility.exe --operation=generate-policy-key \
    --policy_key_output_file=policy_key_file.bin --policy_cert_output_file=policy_cert_file.bin
```

6b. Embed the policy key in Gramine example_app.
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/embed_policy_key.exe --input=policy_cert_file.bin --output=../policy_key.cc

6. Build Gramine-Certifier app
This command builds the application that is run within a Gramine enclave.
First, the make builds a binary with the Gramine library and the Gramine app. This binary
in conjunction with the files listed in the Gramine manifest are packaged together. They
are input to the gramine-sgx-sign to obtain an SGX specific manifest file which
controls the trusted enclave's TCB. The gramine-sgx-token is run to obtain security
parameters such as MR_ENCLAVE, MR_SIGNER and other SGX attributes which can be used to
verify the enclave and the SGX platform. MR_ENCLAVE is the measurement of the enclave.
```
cd $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR
make -f gramine_example_app.mak app RA_TYPE=dcap
```

To clean up built files:
```
make -f gramine_example_app.mak clean
```

7. Policy generation
--------------------
Author the policy for the security domain and produce the signed claims the apps need.

7a. Obtain the measurement of the trusted application
MR_ENCLAVE_HASH is printed in the output of gramine-sgx-get-token after building the
app in the step above.

```
cd $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR/provisioning
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/measurement_utility.exe --mrenclave=<MR_ENCLAVE_HASH> \
        --output=gramine_app.measurement
```

7b. Construct platform key policy
```
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_unary_vse_clause.exe --cert-subject=sgx.cert.der \
        --verb="is-trusted-for-attestation" --output=ts1.bin
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_indirect_vse_clause.exe --key_subject=policy_key_file.bin \
        --verb="says" --clause=ts1.bin --output=vse_policy1.bin
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_signed_claim_from_vse_clause.exe \
        --vse_file=vse_policy1.bin --duration=9000 \
        --private_key_file=policy_key_file.bin --output=signed_claim_1.bin
```

7c. Construct the measurement policy
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_unary_vse_clause.exe --key_subject="" \
        --measurement_subject=gramine_app.measurement --verb="is-trusted" \
        --output=ts2.bin
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_indirect_vse_clause.exe --key_subject=policy_key_file.bin \
        --verb="says" --clause=ts2.bin --output=vse_policy2.bin
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/make_signed_claim_from_vse_clause.exe --vse_file=vse_policy2.bin \
        --duration=9000 --private_key_file=policy_key_file.bin --output=signed_claim_2.bin

7d. Construct the trusted platform policy
TBD in a later step.

7e. Package the policy for the certifier
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/package_claims.exe --input=signed_claim_1.bin,signed_claim_2.bin\
  --output=policy.bin

7f. [optional] Print the policy
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/utilities/print_packaged_claims.exe --input=policy.bin


8. Setup and run Certifier Service/SimpleServer:
------------------------------------------------
8a. Compile the protobuf
```
cd $CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE
cd certifier_service/certprotos
protoc --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go_out=. --go_opt=M=certifier.proto ./certifier.proto
cd certifier_service/oelib
make dummy
```

This should produce a go file for the certifier protobufs called certifier.pb.go in certprotos.

8c. Now build simpleclient and simpeserver:
```
cd $CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/certifier_service
go build simpleserver.go
```

8d. Create directories for app and service data
```
cd $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR
mkdir -p app1_data app2_data service
```

8e. Provision the app files
```
cd $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR/provisioning
cp ./* $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR/app1_data
cp ./* $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR/app2_data
```

8f. Provision the service files
cd $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR/provisioning
cp policy_key_file.bin policy_cert_file.bin policy.bin $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR/service

8g. Start the Certifier Service
In a new terminal window:
```
cd $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR/service
$CERTIFIER_PROTOTYPE/certifier_service/simpleserver \
      --policyFile=policy.bin --readPolicy=true
```

9. Run the apps after getting admission certificates from Certifier Service
---------------
9a. Get admission certificates
  Open two new terminals (one for the app as a client and one for the app as a server):

  In app as a client terminal run the following:
```
    cd $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR
    $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR/gramine_example_app --print_all=true \
      --operation=cold-init --data_dir=./app1_data/ --policy_store_file=policy_store
    $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR/gramine_example_app --print_all=true \
      --operation=get-certifier --data_dir=./app1_data/ --policy_store_file=policy_store
```

  In app as a server terminal run the following:
```
    cd $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR
    $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR/gramine_example_app --print_all=true \
      --operation=cold-init --data_dir=./app2_data/ --policy_store_file=policy_store
    $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR/gramine_example_app --print_all=true \
      --operation=get-certifier --data_dir=./app2_data/ --policy_store_file=policy_store
```

At this point, both versions of the app have their admission certificates.  You can look at
the output of the terminal running simpleserver for output.  Now all we have to do is have
the apps connect to each other for the final test.  The Certifier Service is no longer needed
at this point.

9b. Run the apps to test trusted services
In app as a server terminal run the following:
```
    cd $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR
    $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR/gramine_example_app --print_all=true --operation=run-app-as-server --data_dir=./app2_data/ \
      --policy_store_file=policy_store
```

  In app as a client terminal run the following:
```
    cd $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR
    $GRAMINE_EXAMPLE_DIR/gramine_example_app --print_all=true --operation=run-app-as-client --data_dir=./app1_data/ \
      --policy_store_file=policy_store
```

You should see the message "Hi from your secret server" in the client terminal window and
"Hi from your secret client".   If so, your first Confidential Computing program worked!

App will run the simple server and client app and return a success/failure
result. Gramine automatically talks to the configured DCAP libraries and SGX QV libraries
which in turn communicate with the remote Intel PCS to verify the obtained SGX quote
after comparing it with the cached certificates. The Gramine application enclave through
the Gramine SDK, talks to the Quoting Enclave which in turn interacts with the Intel PCE
and the PCS. The quote verifier caches these certificates and when an SGX quote arrives,
it can validate with these cached certificates. The remote verification in this app 
talks to the DCAP library and verifies the obtained SGX quote. The SGX quote contains
security characteristics such as MR_ENCLAVE, MR_SIGNER, PROD_ID and CPU_SVN to be used
for verification of the enclave and the SGX platform.

Additional Notes
----------------
Some Gramine applications are built with a self-signed SSL certificate with the SGX quote
embedded in it. This certificate is used for establishing a trusted communication channel.
This is not required and we do not generate either the key or the self-signed cert.

The manifest contains the files to be trusted as part of the SGX enclave. The manifest
also specifies the gramine.libos entrypoint, library paths included, file system mounts
that are to be part of the enclave. SGX specific environment variables can also be set in
the manifest.
