Certifier Framework for Confidential Computing 
==============================================

The Certifier Framework for Confidential Computing consists of a client API 
called the certifier API and server based policy evaluation server called
the Certifier Service.

The Certifier API greatly simplifies and unifies programming and
operations support for multi-vendor Confidential Computing platforms
by providing simple client trust management including attestation evaluation,
secure storage, platform initialization, secret sharing, secure channels
and other services.

The Certifier Service provides support for scalable, policy driven
trust management including attestation evaluation, application upgrade
and other Confidential Computing Trust services.
