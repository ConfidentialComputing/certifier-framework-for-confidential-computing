Building the Policy Generator:

You will need the json-schema-validator library which in turn depends on the
JSON for Modern C++ library. Follow the following instructions to have them
built and installed on your system:

git clone https://github.com/nlohmann/json.git
cd json
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install

git clone https://github.com/pboettch/json-schema-validator.git
cd json-schema-validator
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..
make
make install

Both libraries should be install under /usr/local by default. If this is not
the case, remember to update the JSON_VALIDATOR variable in
policy_generator.mak.

The Policy Generator utility can then be built using:

make -f policy_generator.mak

You can then use the generator by invoking:

policy_generator.exe --policy_input=<your policy JSON>

By default, the generator is using policy_schema.json in the same directory as
schema input. If you want to use a custom schema, use the --schema_input
option:

policy_generator.exe --policy_input=<your policy JSON> --schema_input=<your schema JSON>
