Writing an applicaation service based  CC app with the Certifier Framework
==========================================================================

The example app shows all the major steps in a Confidential Computing Program,
running under an application-service which allows.

These steps are made much simpler by the Certifier API as indicated in
instructions.txt. As with the simple_app, the instructions are detailed
and generally similar except for the application-service features.  These
include starting the application my sending a meesage to the application
service to start the program and actually running such a service.  This
is demonstrated in the application_service directory where application_service
is built.

For the Certifier Service, there are almost no changes.  For the Application,
since in enjoys access to the Linux API, there are few changes.  Most
involve a little extra setup to establish and managed pipes with the app-service,
acting as a parent.  CC calls are made over these pipes.  The application
code is nearly identical with simple_example.
