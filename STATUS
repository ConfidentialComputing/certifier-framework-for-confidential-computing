This is an early beta release.  While all code works, we are actively
seeking feedback and partners. Some interfaces may change as a result.
We will also be adding more samples and instructions throughout the
Beta period as well as a little more utility support for SEV.  You are
welcome to use the current version, however.  Consider contributing!

Best,

The Certifier Framework for COnfidential Computing Team
